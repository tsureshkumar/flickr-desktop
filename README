FlickrWallPaper
----------------

This project is a small tool that I wrote to automatically download
the interesting pictures from Flickr and save it in a folder on the
linux machine. This also generates an xml file which the gnome
wallpaper changer uses to slide through the images.

This project is also started so that I can learn scala, databinder's
http client library, etc.

Compile
-------
You need to install simple-build-tool[1] to compile the project. 

clone this git repositary. run sbt at the root folder. 

> compile

compiles the project.

Running
-------
You need to have a flickr api key to run this tool. Visit Flickr's
appgarden to get a key for you.

This is how you need to run this tool

sbt
> run <flickr.key> <folder.to.save> <number.of.photos.to.download> <wait.for.next.sync.in.ms>
